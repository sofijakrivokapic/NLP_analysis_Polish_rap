Dear reader,

Welcome to our report for a research project under the name "NLP analysis: Polish Rap Music"! We are very excited to show you our project, methods we used, and all the exciting results we obtained.

## Motivation

Apart from this research being part of our course requirement for _Introduction to Natural Language processing_ class at University of Warsaw (incorporated in Master programme Cognitive Science), with this research we wanted to express our appreciation for Polish rap culture, and add our own contribution to it.

## Summary

Our analysis provided valuable insights into the lyrical styles of different Polish rap artists. We examined the usage of unique words per artist, identifying those who exhibited the most distinctive vocabularies. Additionally, we delved into the average number of syllables used by each artist, shedding light on the complexity of
their lyrics. Moreover, the topic classification (LDA) revealed prevalent themes in Polish rap music, ranging from life and city experiences to self-expression and emotion.

You can find full report of our research on this repository under the name ***"Final_Report.pdf"***. Additionally, If you want to contact us for further information or clarification you can use email **sofijakrivokapic2@gmail.com**.
