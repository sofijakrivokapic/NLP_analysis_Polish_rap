# INTRODUCTION

Dear reader,

Welcome to our report for a research project under the name "NLP analysis: Polish Rap Music"! We are very excited to show you our project, methods we used, and all the exciting results we obtained.

## Motivation

Apart from this research being part of our course requirement for _Introduction to Natural Language processing_ class at University of Warsaw (incorporated in Master programme Cognitive Science), with this research we wanted to express our appreciation for Polish rap culture, and add our own contribution to it.

## Summary

In our project we decided to look into the characteristics of Polish rap lyrics by analyzing unique words and checking which artists use more multisyllable words. We also performed topic classification (LDA) to learn about the most salient themes present in Polish rap music.
